# Prediction-of-adaptor-proteins-using-PSSM-profiles-and-Recurrent-Neural-Networks.-
This study opens the path for Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) structures to be employed in computational biology and bioinformatics. The research approach we promote for is applicable to scientists who aim to improve the prediction results of protein function prediction problems.
